## Overview


**mpv** is a free (as in freedom) media player for the command line. It supports
a wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types.

There is a [FAQ][FAQ].

Releases can be found on the [release list][releases].

## System requirements

- A not too ancient Linux, Windows 7 or later, or OSX 10.8 or later.
- A somewhat capable CPU. Hardware decoding might help if the CPU is too slow to
  decode video in realtime, but must be explicitly enabled with the `--hwdec`
  option.
- A not too crappy GPU. mpv's focus is not on power-efficient playback on
  embedded or integrated GPUs (for example, hardware decoding is not even
  enabled by default). Low power GPUs may cause issues like tearing, stutter,
  etc. The main video output uses shaders for video rendering and scaling,
  rather than GPU fixed function hardware. On Windows, you might want to make
  sure the graphics drivers are current. In some cases, ancient fallback video
  output methods can help (such as `--vo=xv` on Linux), but this use is not
  recommended or supported.

## Downloads


For semi-official builds and third-party packages please see
[mpv.io/installation](http://mpv.io/installation/).

## Changelog


There is no complete changelog; however, changes to the player core interface
are listed in the [interface changelog][interface-changes].

Changes to the C API are documented in the [client API changelog][api-changes].

The [release list][releases] has a summary of most of the important changes
on every release.

Changes to the default key bindings are indicated in
[restore-old-bindings.conf][restore-old-bindings].

## Compilation


Compiling with full features requires development files for several
external libraries. Below is a list of some important requirements.

The mpv build system uses [waf](https://waf.io/), but we don't store it in the
repository. The `./bootstrap.py` script will download the latest version
of waf that was tested with the build system.

For a list of the available build options use `./waf configure --help`. If
you think you have support for some feature installed but configure fails to
detect it, the file `build/config.log` may contain information about the
reasons for the failure.

NOTE: To avoid cluttering the output with unreadable spam, `--help` only shows
one of the two switches for each option. If the option is autodetected by
default, the `--disable-***` switch is printed; if the option is disabled by
default, the `--enable-***` switch is printed. Either way, you can use
`--enable-***` or `--disable-**` regardless of what is printed by `--help`.

To build the software you can use `./waf build`: the result of the compilation
will be located in `build/mpv`. You can use `./waf install` to install mpv
to the *prefix* after it is compiled.

Example:

    ./bootstrap.py
    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./waf install

Essential dependencies (incomplete list):

- gcc or clang
- X development headers (xlib, xrandr, xext, xscrnsaver, xinerama, libvdpau,
  libGL, GLX, EGL, xv, ...)
- Audio output development headers (libasound/ALSA, pulseaudio)
- FFmpeg libraries (libavutil libavcodec libavformat libswscale libavfilter
  and either libswresample or libavresample)
- zlib
- iconv (normally provided by the system libc)
- libass (OSD, OSC, text subtitles)
- Lua (optional, required for the OSC pseudo-GUI and youtube-dl integration)
- libjpeg (optional, used for screenshots only)
- uchardet (optional, for subtitle charset detection)
- nvdec and vaapi libraries for hardware decoding on Linux (optional)

Libass dependencies (when building libass):

- gcc or clang, yasm on x86 and x86_64
- fribidi, freetype, fontconfig development headers (for libass)
- harfbuzz (optional, required for correct rendering of combining characters,
  particularly for correct rendering of non-English text on OSX, and
  Arabic/Indic scripts on any platform)

FFmpeg dependencies (when building FFmpeg):

- gcc or clang, yasm on x86 and x86_64
- OpenSSL or GnuTLS (have to be explicitly enabled when compiling FFmpeg)
- libx264/libmp3lame/libfdk-aac if you want to use encoding (have to be
  explicitly enabled when compiling FFmpeg)
- For native DASH playback, FFmpeg needs to be built with --enable-libxml2
  (although there are security implications, and DASH support has lots of bugs).
- AV1 decoding support requires dav1d.
- For good nvidia support on Linux, make sure nv-codec-headers is installed
  and can be found by configure.

Most of the above libraries are available in suitable versions on normal
Linux distributions. For ease of compiling the latest git master of everything,
you may wish to use the separately available build wrapper ([mpv-build][mpv-build])
which first compiles FFmpeg libraries and libass, and then compiles the player
statically linked against those.

If you want to build a Windows binary, you either have to use MSYS2 and MinGW,
or cross-compile from Linux with MinGW. See
[Windows compilation][windows_compilation].
